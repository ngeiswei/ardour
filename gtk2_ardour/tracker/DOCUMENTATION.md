# Ardour Tracker Editor

### Channel Column

In Dec mode, the channel column begins from 1, like in Ardour.  However, in Hex
mode, the channel column begins from 0.  For instance channel 1 is displayed as
channel 0 and channel 16 is displayed as channel F.

Please beware that the spinner for the default channel will remain in Dec mode.
